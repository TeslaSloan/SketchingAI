# SketchingAI
Sketching AI, based on a convolutional neural network and genetic algorithm

Not really intended for distribution yet, but it works if you install a few things (all free and working under Linux):

1. Install Anaconda https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/
2. Install Caffe http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/
3. Download the sketch dataset http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/classifysketch/

Nothing is really optimized (either in speed or "accuracy") and the code is a bit of a mess for now, I just meant to put it out there while I work on other things.

An album of a few images produced by the AI are here: http://imgur.com/a/0ag4u  You can guess what they are, read on to know the actual categories: brain, butterfly, alarm clock, hourglass, and trousers (the hourglass was a color experiment with real pictures, not the sketch database). Here's a video of the process in action, when asked for a snowman: http://gfycat.com/ComplexMelodicLacewing (200 generations)
